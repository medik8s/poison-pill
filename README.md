# Poison Pill k8s Node Remediation 
Existing baremetal remediation strategies utilize BMC credentials to power-cycle and/or reprovision the host.
However there are also environments that either do not include BMCs, or there are policies
in place that prevent them from being utilized.  Such environments would also benefit from
the ability to safely recover affected workloads and restore cluster capacity (where possible).
This poison pill controller is using an alternate mechanism for a node in a cluster to detect its health
status and take actions to remediate itself in case of a failure.  While not all remediation events can
result in the node returning to a healthy state, the proposal does allow surviving parts of the cluster
to assume the node has reached a safe state so that itâ€™s workloads can be automatically recovered.
This work can also be useful for clusters with BMC credentials.

## Backlog
1. Peer to peer authentication and encryption
1. Marking the poison pill pod as critical pod to avoid eviction
1. Ask multiple peers concurrently instead of one by one
1. create a flow chart to describe the algorithm visually
1. OLM integration
